Atliq Hardware (fictional company) is a prominent computer hardware manufacturer in India and has also successfully expanded its presence in other countries. The company specializes in selling computers and computer accessories through three different channels: retailers, direct sales, and distributors. However, the company recently encountered an unexpected setback when it opened a store in America, with the aim of surpassing its competitors in the market and making data-driven decisions based on surveys.

## Business Related Terms
- Fiscal year : The duration of the project spans a fiscal year, which begins in September instead of the traditional calendar year starting in January. 
               This decision is based on the fact that the company experiences its peak sales during the particular month.

- Gross sales amount = Quantity * Price of the product in a specific Fiscal Year 

- Pre-invoice discount amount = Pre-invoice Discount Percentage * Gross Sales Amount 

- Net invoice Sales Amount = Gross Sales Amount - Pre-Invoice Discount Amount 

- Net Sales = Net Invoice Sales Amount - Post-Invoice Discount Amount 

- Cost Of Goods Sold = Manufacturing Cost + Freight (Transportation) Cost  + Other Costs 

- Gross Margin = Net Sales - Cost of Goods Sold

- Net Profit = Gross Margin - Operational Cost (This Cost is associated with Spending on Marketing, Promotions , etc)

- Net Profit % = Net Profit / Net Sales 

- Gross Margin % = Gross Margin / Net Sales 

- Gross Margin per unit = Gross Margin / Quantity 

- Absolute Net Error = Forecast Quantity - Sales Quantity

- Absolute Net Error % = Sum of absolute Error / Sum of Forecast Quantity

- Forecast Accuracy = 1 - Absolute Net Error
